# Hi Im Vo!
 
Im a 18 year old memphis native. I've just started my software development and i'm excited to become advanced in my craft!

I became interested in technology at a very young age. The thought and creativity of games and devices pulled me in and I knew that was something I could be apart of. I declined 7 college scholarships with purest of faith to pursue MY dream and I promise I intend to have it.
